    "    (or `pip install ipykernel` also works)  \n",

    "When importing custom functions from your own `helpful_abstraction.py` files, iPython will only actually read the file the very first time it's imported. If you're actively editing that `helpful_abstraction.py` file, even if you re-run the `import helpful_abstraction as ha` line of code, all iPython does is say \"I already have that cached in memory, I'll be efficient and NOT read it from the source\" so you're stuck unless you restart the whole kernel and start from the top again. To fix this, we can use a built-in magic method called \"autoreload\". At the top of your notebook, simply put the following two lines:  \n",
