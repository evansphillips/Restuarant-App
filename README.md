This is a project 1 for OOP. 

You should aim for around 300 to 500 lines of code. You will not be graded on the number of lines of code you write nor will this be a comparison of projects implemented by your peers. For example, a project with 500 lines of code is not guaranteed to do better than a project with 300 lines of code. As we've seen, it's not necessarily the number of lines, it's the value in those lines. Being concise is a good thing and if you're at all worried that you're not going to hit that soft requirement please let us know.

This project must be composed entirely of objects, with only scripting outside of objects when absolutely necessary
This project must not exceed 750 lines of code
For example, if you have a text game you can put the text in a separate file
The line count requirement does not include whitespace or comments (please include both to make your code readable)
Your code should be sufficiently complex to require at least 5 separate classes (but are not likely to need more than 10 classes)
The objects should be different levels of complexity, for example some may be basic containers and others should manage those containers (i.e. a menu-serving object and/or a game-play object) as well as demonstrating various flow control and data types
The project will be run from the command line as a .py file.
The project needs to have a user-interface and be interactive with a user
The project needs to do some user error checking as well as have a help 'screen' or printed instructions for the user
All code needs to be well commented with both comments and docstrings
Without specific permission, you may not use anything outside of the standard Anaconda-installed libraries.
Please include all references that you used to build out your application.
While it is acceptable and even desirable to take inspiration and learn specific syntax from previous projects and stackoverflow code, this code base must be your own work.
YouTube presentation

The YouTube presentation will consist of you quickly running through your program to show some of the interesting features. Please include an explanation of your code also. Overall the presentation should be no more than 5 minutes.

Reflection Document (10 points)

When submitting your final code, include a ~one page reflection document containing:

Instructions about how we should go about testing and using your project
What you completed and anything that you didn't complete in the project that you would finish later
Discuss challenges you faced and how you overcame them
Please make this document a pdf before uploading to github!
For advanced students

You might want to use proactive packaging for your code base to present it in a professional manner
